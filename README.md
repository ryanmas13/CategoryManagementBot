Additional information about Llamaindex chat engines: 
LlamaIndex has four different chat engines:

1. Condense question engine: Always queries the knowledge base. Can have trouble with meta questions like ‚ÄúWhat did I previously ask you?‚Äù

2. Context chat engin": Always queries the knowledge base and uses retrieved text from the knowledge base as context for following queries. The retrieved context from previous queries can take up much of the available context for the current query.

3. ReAct agent: Chooses whether to query the knowledge base or not. Its performance is more dependent on the quality of the LLM. You may need to coerce the chat engine to correctly choose whether to query the knowledge base.

4. OpenAI agent: Chooses whether to query the knowledge base or not‚Äîsimilar to ReAct agent mode, but uses OpenAI‚Äôs built-in fuOpenAI'salling capabilities.

We will use the OpenAI agent here.
